   """ 
      Process the out-edges of a given task (which we presumably just executed). 

      This function doesn't do much of the processing itself; instead, it offloads the processing to one of two functions: process_small() or process_big(). The function
      used is dependant upon the size of the given task's intermediate output data.

      This function also processes the previous_results dictionary to determine if any locally cached data can be uncached in the interest of saving space/not running
      out of memory within the Lambda function. For each item stored in previous_results, we iterate over the tasks which use that item. If the task has (1) been executed
      locally or (2) has a value existing in Redis already (meaning some other Lambda executed it), then we do not need to keep track of the data. If at least one task
      which depends on the cached item has not been executed yet (locally or externally), then we keep the data cached for now.

      Args:
         out_edges [PathNode]: The out-edges we're processing. These are the immediate down-stream edges from the last task we executed on this Lambda function.
         
         node_processing (UnprocessedNode): The UnprocessedNode object associated with the task we are now processing.
         
         nodes_map_serialized (Dict): This is a map of TASK-KEY --> SERIALIZED PathNode OBJECT for all of the nodes in the current path.
         
         nodes_map_deserialized (Dict): This is a cache of deserialized PathNodes. The nodes contained within are a subnet of those within 'nodes_map_serialized'.
         
         previous_results (Dict): Local cache of intermediate output data from tasks executed on this Lambda function.
         
         tasks_to_fargate_nodes (Dict): A map of TASK-KEY --> FARGATE NODE IP's.
         
         use_bit_dep_checking (bool): If True, use check_dependency_counter_bits for checking dependencies. If False, use check_dependency_counter.
         
         needs_become = True (Bool): If true, then we still don't have a node/task we can 'become' within the current path. We will attempt to find one while processing.
         
         lambda_execution_breakdown (LambdaExecutionBreakdown): Metric data for the Lambda function itself.
         
         current_task_execution_breakdown (TaskExecutionBreakdown): Metric data associated with the task we just executed.
         
         task_execution_breakdowns (Dict): A map from TASK-KEY --> TaskExecutionBreakdown for all the tasks we've executed on this Lambda function.
         
         leaf_key (str): This will only be non-null if this Lambda began as a leaf task AND the Scheduler may try to re-use the Lambda function.
                         If it is non-null, then its value will be the key of the leaf task. We use this to make sure we leave the leaf task's data
                         in the previous_results dictionary.

         context (Context): AWS Lambda Context object.

      Returns:
         ([Nodes], Node, Bool) -- Returns a 3-tuple (x,y,z) such that:
            x: A list of nodes that we need to process next (the next set of out-edges to process, basically),
            y: The current 'become' node. If we need a become node still, then this node will potentially be used.
            z: Whether or not we already have the Path in which 'current_become_node' is contained.
