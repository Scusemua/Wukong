        Paths are used by Workers to execute tasks in the DAG. The Path contains all information required to execute
        tasks (ideally). In some circumstances, workers will need to grab the path from Redis. The worker may also
        need to grab other paths invoked by the current path from Redis (and then send these paths to the Lambda invocations). 
        Another option is passing the Redis key to the Lambda invocation, and the new Lambda function would just grab its path from Redis.

        AWS Lambda invocations are limited to a 256KB payload so that is what we are constrained by in terms of sending paths directly
        to workers versus grabbing paths from Redis.
